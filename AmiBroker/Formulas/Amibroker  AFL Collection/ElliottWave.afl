/*********************************************************************
		Plotting Elliott Wave

Variables:
--Variable 'array' holds the values to be plotted
  as waves.
-- H1, L1 are high and low of previous day
-- H2, L2 are high and low of current day

Method:
array =
1. High: When H2>H1 and L2>L1, ie higher high and higher low.
2. Low: When L2<L1 and H1<H2, ie lower high and lower low.
3. This case arises when either of the bar falls within the range
of the other bar. This is where the confusion arises. I wasn't 
able to find the best one. 
In this scenario, we take High or Low according to the "direction"
of the median price, (H+L)/2, of those two bars.

Line chart of High and Low of each day is also plotted, so that 
we can overcome the inefficiency occured due to step 3 above. 
ie we may refer them whenever we have confusion or confirmation
is needed.
