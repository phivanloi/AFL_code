/*THE TRUTH ABOUT VOLATILITY - Feb2005 S&C

In "The Truth About Volatility," Jim Berg presents how to use several well-known volatility measures 
such as average True range (ATR) to calculate entry, trailing stop, AND profit-taking levels. 
Implementing techniques presented in the article is very simple using the AmiBroker Formula Language (Afl), 
AND takes just a few lines of code.

Listing 1 shows the formula that the plots color-coded price chart, trailing stop, AND profit-taking lines, 
as well as a colored ribbon showing volatility-based entry AND exit signals. The relative strength 
index (RSI) used by Berg is a built-in indicator in AmiBroker, so no additional code is necessary.

EntrySignal = C > ( LLV( L, 20 ) + 2 * ATR( 10 ) );
ExitSignal = C < ( HHV( H, 20 ) - 2 * ATR( 10 ) );

TrailStop = HHV( C - 2 * ATR(10), 15 );
ProfitTaker = EMA( H, 13 ) + 2 * ATR(10);
