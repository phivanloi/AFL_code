Intraday Range and Periods Framer

This script will draw horizontal lines for the following items:

- Previous day close (red dashed line)
- Today open (pink dotted line)
- Today high and low (pink lines)
- Premarket range 8:30am to 9:30am EST (blue dashed lines)
- 5 min opening range (dark green lines)
- 30 mintue opening range (light green lines)

It also draws yellow vertical lines marking the following periods:
- Day start (blue triangle)
- Day end (red triangle)
- 5 min opening period end (dark green triangle)
- 30 minute period end (light green triangle)
- Mid day slow period (gray triangles)

The important part of this script is that it shows how to get
accurate values from the TimeFrameCompress and TimeFrameExpand
functions when displaying intraday data on a chart that is not 
limited to market hours only (9:30am to 4:00pm EST).  If you
did not use the methods shown in this script, then the TF functions
might return values that you did not want.  You would still get 
open, high, low, and prev clos values, but they would most likely 
off as they would include the pre and post market values as well.
By using arrays of boolean values indicating what period the each
bar in is, the TF functions can then be used effectively while
still showing all data the 24 hour period has to offer.

I leave it up to you to put alerts or filtering criteria in the script.
