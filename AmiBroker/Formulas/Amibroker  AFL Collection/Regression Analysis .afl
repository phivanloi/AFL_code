/* Regression Analysis - Graph a Straight Line
** AFL Implementation by Frank Snay
** The Program is designed to graph a user defined length, straight regression 
** analysis line.  Percentage lines, also user defined, are drawn above and
** below the regression analysis line.  
** A user defined "DaysBack" draws the line back (think AFL code ref() ) from 
** the current end of the data for those who want to see a graphed, historical
** line from previous days.  Setting "DaysBack" to zero ends the graph on the
** current last database day.
** Candlestick code displayed, with the green box with white fill being a day where
** the close exceeds the open, and a red box with black fill being a day where the
** open exceeds the close. (Tj - any way to make the fill the same color as the boxes?)
** Use Automatic scaling, Grid: Middle + ShowDates 
** THE FOLLOWING ARE USER INPUTS FOR THE DESIRED RESULTS:
** User Input - Number of Days for Regression Analysis Line Study  */
