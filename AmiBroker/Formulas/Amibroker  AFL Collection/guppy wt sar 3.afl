/*The Guppy Multiple Moving Average (GMMA) indicator tool is based on the relationships between groups of moving averages. 
Each group of averages in the GMMA provides insight into the behavior of the two dominant groups in the market - traders and investors. 
The indicator allows the trader to understand the market relationships shown in the chart and so select the most appropriate trading methodology and the best tools. 
The GMMA is designed to understand the nature of trend activity on an end of day, or intraday basis.

The inferred activity of traders is tracked by using a group of short term moving averages. 
The traders always lead the change in trend. 
Their buying pushes up prices in anticipation of a trend change. 
Their activity is shown by a 3, 5, 8, 10, 12 and 15 day group of exponentially calculated moving averages. 

The trend survives only if other buyers also come into the market. 
Strong trends are supported by long term investors. 
The investor takes more time to recognize the change in a trend but he always follows the lead set by traders. 
We track the investors' inferred activity by using a group of long term moving averages. 
This group is 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 60 day exponentially calculated moving averages. 


The relationship within each of these groups tells us when there is agreement on value - when they are close together 
and when there is disagreement on value - when they are well spaced apart.

When we combine multiple moving averages, a short term group and a long term group, 
we can see when the market has reached an agreement about the value of the stock. 
This can be used to understand the strength of the trend. Sustained activity of the short term averages above the long term group confirms a strong trend. 
The short term group will fluctuate, but while the long term group is in a steady band it suggests long term support.

Signs of a weakening of the trend are when both groups of averages begin to narrow down 
and fluctuate more than is normal given their past recent activity. If both groups converge towards a crossover, then a trend reversal is signalled.

The relationship between the two groups tells the trader about the strength of the market action. 
A change in price direction that is well supported by both short and long term investors signals a strong trading opportunity. 
The crossover of the two groups of moving averages is not as important as the relationship between them.
